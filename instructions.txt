This program starts with the following parameters:
Overview mode
Camera navigation
Design materials
Textures on
Texture blending
Per-vertex normals

Per-vertex normals are not calculated initially for some complex objects.
The basic cube and cylinder structures have vertex normals, but the complex 
meshes calculate per-vertex normals gradually as the program runs, one 
normal per drawing. When all normals are calculated, the model will
then be rendered using per-vertex normals.
